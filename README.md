# macOSLucidaGrande
As the name suggests, this is a small utility to set Lucida Grande as your Mac's system font.
- Easily switch between Lucida Grande and San Francisco as your Mac's system font on macOS Mojave (10.14), macOS High Sierra (10.13), macOS Sierra (10.12) and OS X El Capitan (10.11)
- Easily switch between Lucida Grande and Helvetica Neue as your Mac's system font on OS X Yosemite (10.10)
- Switches between system fonts without modifying system files, making it simple and safe

### Known issues:
- Truncated text may overlap in Safari and Firefox in macOS Mojave (10.14), macOS High Sierra (10.13), macOS Sierra (10.12) and OS X El Capitan (10.11)
- When typing in a password input field in the OS, like iTunes account, there is no * sign appearing when typing a character. The password is typed completely and it is accepted, but password field appears blank before submission (Issue #2).

### Special Thanks:
- **[Alexander Schreiber](https://github.com/schreiberstein)** for creating the amazing original [LucidaGrandeYosemite](https://github.com/schreiberstein/lucidagrandeyosemite) and [LucidaGrandeElCapitan](https://github.com/schreiberstein/lucidagrandeelcapitan). Without his origonal project and his great take on creating diff'ed font patches, this project wouldn't have been possible
